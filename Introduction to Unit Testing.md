This document will outline the theoretical basics of unit testing. 
Though it is planned to be language agnostic, it may tilt towards Python practices as that is my language of choice and where most of my references will be from.

In the initial stages of this document I will be directly referencing a lot of material from various sources online, providing a link to the material for further reading. In other words, this will be an aggregation of resources modified to maintain coherence and flow between the various 'decoupled' parts of the document. :)
