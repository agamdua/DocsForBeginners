DocsForBeginners
================

Things I wish I knew when I was starting out as a programmer.

I'm not an expert. Far from it actually. But there are two advantages I have:

1. I mostly skipped classes in college - which means I'm self taught at almost everything I know about CS/programming. 
This means that I have learned by stumbling upon diverse resources. This collection of docs aims to distill the important parts, so someone who has minimal programming experience can go from say 5 to 50 on a scale of 0-100.
(Note: I don't encourage anyone else to miss classes. Classes just didn't work well for me personally. At the same time, the mentorship I received by various faculty throughout school and college was invaluable.).
2. I'm *extremely* passionate about imparting what little knowledge I have, sharing my mistakes and learnings both.

I hope this will be useful for someone. To be honest, its a the request from a friend who *really* wanted to get coding in Python from a Matlab background that lit the spark to actually *write* this down. I procrastinate a lot. I've heard lazy people are supposed to be smart so I'm trying to take that route!

**Target:** 
- This repository aims to be a collection of docs that will be broken up into pieces which should take no longer than 10mins to read (each). 
- I hope that to a large extent I can make an 'à la carte' kind of collection so readers can proceed both linearly or pick and choose what they would like to be informed.

Disclaimer: These documents will have some bias that reflects my personal experiences. I'm not going to try to avoid that, as I believe a conversational resource will be more useful to a beginner than most of the purely technical approaches out there. 
Right after this, readers should be able to comprehend the 'technical' books in a more informed manner.


Why Github (and Markdown)?
-----------

I like git for managing versions of code that I write. Git is a system for [Version Control](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) used a lot by programmers. Github introduces a web interface and makes the experience more *social*. In this context, I interpret social to be 'making code project collaboration as simple as can be'. Of course, its not restricted to code, I am writing this document in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#overview) andI quote from the link:

"*Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.*"


Why Open Source?
----------------

What's better than having a collection of things you write where people can easily comment on things, log issues (tickets) and even contributing to the docs themselves! Github makes this all easy technically, but the benefits of the community can best be drawn by making it open to all.

Licence
-------

Currently using the MIT license as that is the most permissible license I know of. That means, from whatever I know about open source licenses, it grants you the most rights to do whatever you want. This may change.

Feedback
--------

I'm a lifelong student who is an aspiring eductionist (that's a funny word, isn't it? ha!). Constructive criticism from *anyone* is appreciated.

That's it for the Readme - over to the real stuff now! :)

Disclaimer: Sorry this is the last one, promise! I just wanted to warn you that I use my sense of humour liberally while writing talking. Unfortunately, I'm one of the few people who finds my lovely witticism.. witty. You have been warned. Enjoy the docs (when they get uploaded)!
